# CS210

## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was to create a clock that would display a given time in 12-hour and 24-hour format. The program displays both clocks simultaneously and allows for user input to Add 1 hour, 1 minute, or 1 second. The clock should function as a normal clock, with the 12-hour clock switching from AM to PM at the appropriate times. The 24-hour clock should also roll over to start over at the appropriate time. 

## What did you do particularly well?
I think that I did well with the layouts of the headers and displays that show the clocks with the user input menu. I enjoyed working to make sure that the headers aligned with what was requested from the clients. 

## Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could make my code more efficient by going through and seeing if there is any redundancy within the code. This would make the code more readable and efficient. 


## Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The portion of the code that I found most challenging would be getting the 24-hour clock to rollover at the correct time, while also having the 12-hour clock show the appropriate AM/PM. 

## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Working with using a pre-existing flowchart and and outline of what a customer is looking for is something that I will be able to transfer to other projects and course work. Being able to read a flow chart or psuedocode and using documentation of what a client is looking for is a skill that we can all use with all projects that we are working on. 

## How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this code maintainable and readable by having the code flow through the process to achieve that goal of two functioning clocks. Also, by using inline commments it will allow other programmers to understand what I was trying to achieve at various points in the code.
